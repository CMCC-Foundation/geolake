abstract: >+
  geolake is an open source framework for management,
  storage, and analytics of Earth Science data. geolake
  implements the concept of a data lake as a central
  location that holds a large amount of data in its native
  and raw format. geolake does not impose any schema when
  ingesting the data, however it provides a unified Data
  Model and API for geoscientific datasets. The data is kept
  in the original format and storage, and the in-memory data
  structure is built on-the-fly for the processing analysis.

  The system has been designed using a cloud-native
  architecture, based on containerized microservices, that
  facilitates the development, deployment and maintenance of
  the system itself. It has been implemented by integrating
  different open source frameworks, tools and libraries and
  can be easily deployed using the Kubernetes platform and
  related tools such as kubectl.
