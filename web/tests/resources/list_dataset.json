These indicators (e.g. Annual mean temperature, Temperature annual range, Evapotranspiration, Thermicity, Annual and Seasonal precipitation and many others) are valuable for ecological modeling purposes.  Besides the historical period (1960-1999) from WATCH reanalyses, the 35 indicators  for the future periods are based on time series of climate variables simulated under  a combination of 6 Earth System Models (ESMs), 2 Representative Concentration Pathways  (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and 2 time horizons (2040-2079 and 2060-2099), amounting to a total  of 23 ensemble members for each indicator, all provided as NetCDF files.",

        "description": "The Black Sea physics analysis and Forecasting System (BSFS) is one of the Production Units of the Black Sea Monitoring and Forecasting Centre (BS-MFC), developed in the frame of the Copernicus Marine Environment and Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The physical core is based on a hydrodynamic model implemented over the whole Black Sea basin. The model horizontal grid resolution is 1/36° in zonal direction, 1/27° in meridional direction (ca. 3 km) and has 31 unevenly spaced vertical levels. The hydrodynamics are supplied by the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean (NEMO, v3.4).The model solutions are corrected by the variational assimilation OceanVar (based on a 3DVAR scheme), originally developed for the Mediterranean Sea and later extended for the global ocean. The observations assimilated in the BSFS includes in-situ profiles, along-track sea level anomalies (SLA) and gridded sea surface temperature (SST) provided by Copernicus Thematic Assembly Centres. BSFS provides every day 3 days of analysis, 1 day simulation and 10 days of forecast fields; once per week, the system runs for 14 days in the past to provide the best initial condition for the forecasting cycle. BSFS catalogue offers daily and hourly means from Jul 2018 - ongoing for the following list of variables: temperature, salinity, sea surface height, currents, mixed layer depth and bottom temperature. For further information see <a href=http://bsfs.cmcc.it/backend/public/bsfs/short-description.html>Black Sea Description page</a>. This dataset is delivered using the NEMO model native grid.",

The dataset provides a historical perspective of changes in extreme precipitation across Europe and follows the definitions for the Climate Impact Indices that are defined by the CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices ( ETCCDI ). The datasets on which the Climate Impact Indices are based are the E-OBS observational dataset, which provides daily sums of precipitation, and the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, of which the hourly precipitation sums are used. The value of the current dataset is in the aggregation of these dataset in Climate Impact Indices which provide a more direct view on the climatic variability and change in extreme precipitation than its sources. The selected indices highlight extreme precipitation from various angles: by using both fixed thresholds and percentile thresholds, related to the climate specific for that area, assessments of heavy precipitation events can be made and comparisons between stations can be made, even when the stations are from different climatic conditions. Both the length of wet spells as well as ‘hard extremes’, relating to return levels of up to 100-year, are provided.

It allows city stakeholders to exploit flood risk analysis over the city. The dataset is derived from data available on the Climate Data Store and the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The former includes ERA5 reanalysis data, dynamically downscaled to 2km x 2km grid with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM and accounting for urban parameterization in order to reach the spatial and temporal resolution suitable for pluvial flood analysis at a city scale.

        "description": "This dataset provides rainfall erosivity (R factor), associated indicators, and the potential for soil loss induced by water erosion for Italy. The dataset is derived from integrating rainfall data included in  the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) with non-climate data to assess soil susceptibility to water erosion according to Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach. The gridded dataset can support the decision-making process of many stakeholders for strategical planning purposes across different sectors addressed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The dataset provides: <ul>\n  <li>Key information on water erosion dynamics in terms of R factor and potential soil loss for the historical period. The assessment of R factor uses as input gridded observations (E-OBS) and reanalysis data (ERA5, ERA5-Land) for precipitation included in the CDS. The soil loss assessment is obtained by further operating the R factor derived from ERA5-Land with non-climate gridded data representing soil susceptibility to water erosion in accordance to the RUSLE formulation. These are provided at ≈500m horizontal resolution in this dataset.</li>\n  <li> Key information on water erosion dynamics in terms of R factor and potential soil loss for future periods. The assessment is again based on the RUSLE approach and uses as input precipitation data included in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble climate projections (0.11°) under several Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), still available on the CDS. In this case, bias-corrected monthly precipitation data are used and the R factor is provided both at native horizontal resolution and regridded to ≈500m to be operated with other RUSLE factors to derive potential soil loss for the future. Additional R factor proxy variables, based on daily precipitation data, are provided at native horizontal resolution and as anomalies with respect to the historical period, with no bias-correction. </li>\n</ul>",

The downscaling at very high resolution of ERA5 reanalysis (see dataset <a href=\"https://dds.cmcc.it/#/dataset/era5-downscaled-over-italy\">ERA5-DOWNSCALED-OVER-ITALY</a>)  allows to reproduce the interactions between atmosphere and surface considering spatially detailed land use distribution and was used to calculate the four indicators presented in this dataset: Wind Chill (°C), Humidex (°C), Discomfort Index (°C), Apparent Temperature (°C). The cooling index, called Wind Chill (WC), expresses the cooling sensation caused by the combined effect of temperature and wind; it is based on the formulation of Osczevski &amp; Bluestein (2005). The discomfort index (DI) is considered one of the best indices to estimate, in a single value, the effect of temperature and humidity on the sensation of heat or cold perceived by the human body; it is derived from Thom and Bosen (1959). The Humidex (H) it is based on a simple empirical relationship that considers the air temperature and vapor pressure, the latter in turn function of temperature and relative humidity, and calculated according to Masterton and Richardson (1979). Finally, the Apparent Temperature (AT) considers all the environmental and body conditions that influence human thermoregulation; Steadman (1984) implemented an empirical formula for AT, under outside shaded environment, that combines air temperature, vapor pressure and wind speed. The temporal coverage of the dataset is from 01/01/1989 00:00 to 31/12/2020 23:00 and the temporal resolution is 1 hour.

        "description": "E-OBS is a daily gridded land-only observational dataset over Europe. The blended time series from the station network of the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project form the basis for the E-OBS gridded dataset. All station data are sourced directly from the European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) or other data holding institutions.  <br> E-OBS comes as an ensemble dataset and is available on a 0.1 and 0.25 degree regular grid for the elements daily mean temperature TG, daily minimum temperature TN, daily maximum temperature TX, daily precipitation sum RR, daily averaged sea level pressure PP and daily mean global radiation QQ. They cover the area: 25N-71.5N x 25W-45E. The data files are in NetCDF-4 format. The Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30), a global raster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 kilometer) developed by USGS is used for the elevation file as well. <br> The ensemble dataset is constructed through a conditional simulation procedure. For each of the members of the ensemble a spatially correlated random field is produced using a pre-calculated spatial correlation function. The mean across the members is calculated and is provided as the \"best-guess\" fields. The spread is calculated as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles over the ensemble to provide a measure indicate of the 90% uncertainty range. The global radiation dataset has a 10-member ensemble, while the other elements have a 100-member ensemble. For more details see Cornes et al. (2018) and the <a href=\"https://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/userguidance/use_ensembles.php\">guidance on how to use ensemble datasets</a>. <br> The position of E-OBS is unique in Europe because of the relatively high spatial horizontal grid spacing, the daily resolution of the dataset, the provision of multiple variables and the length of the dataset. The dataset is daily, meaning the observations cover 24 hours per time step. The exact 24-hour period can be different per region. The reason for this is that some data providers measure between midnight to midnight while others might measure from morning to morning. Since E-OBS is an observational dataset, no attempts have been made to adjust time series for this 24-hour offset. It is made sure, where known, that the largest part of the measured 24-hour period corresponds to the day attached to the time step in E-OBS (and ECA&D).",
