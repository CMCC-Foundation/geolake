    The dataset contains dynamically downscaled ERA5 reanalysis, originally
    available at ≈31 km x 31 km horizontal resolution, to 2.2 km x 2.2 km.
    Dynamical downscaling has been conducted directly for the project
    (foreground) through Regional Climate Model (RCM) COSMO5.0_CLM9 e
    INT2LM 2.06. The RCM COSMO CLM is currently developed by the CLM-Community, with
    which CMCC collaborates since 2008 (additional info on <a href="https://www.cmcc.it/models/cosmo-clm-climate-limited-area-modelling-community">COSMO CLM</a>).
    The temporal resolution of outputs is hourly (like for ERA5).
    Runs cover the whole Italian territory (and neighbouring areas according to
    the necessary computation boundary) so to provide a very detailed (in
    terms of space-time resolution) and comprehensive (in terms of
    meteorological fields) dataset of climatological data for at least the last 30 years (01/1989-10/2020).
    Typical use of similar dataset is (applied) research and downstream services (e.g. for decision support system)
    <br>
    The temporal coverage of the dataset is from 01/01/1989 00:00 to 31/12/2020 23:00 and the temporal resolution is 1 hour.
    All output variables (reported in the following table) are on single levels except soil water content that is provided for 7 soil levels.
